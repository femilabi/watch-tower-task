A consensus arrangement is the best way to achieve that.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“The party has, on several occasions in the past, adopted consensus approaches.

There’s no law in the country that says that if you serve one term, you cannot go for a second term.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“And as a matter of fact, conventionally speaking, incumbent people tend to get the right of first refusal before other people.

So, if the delegates of the party feel a certain way about any member, including myself, I don’t think you can fight such a process. I believe that democracy should be allowed to flow so that you don’t end the aspirations (of others). And that is why we are going to oppose anyone who tries to truncate this process.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>On consensus, he stated, “Consensus is a dangerous democratic right.

At the end of the day, when they are voting, they will vote along the mood of the party and the country, so that we don’t end up where we are coming from.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>On his part, Odeyemi urged caution and described consensus as the most effective arrangement to safeguard the party.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>He stated, “It is too early to throw support behind anyone now, because the party has been in crisis for quite some time. This, obviously, must have raised the stakes and the quality of leadership that it requires to bring the party back on track.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“We are still looking forward to seeing how many of them will come out. I would rather prefer we wait and see all of them before comparing notes and assessing them based on their previous achievements and contributions to the party before we can say anything.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“The Constitution of the party does not ban anybody from contesting. It’s a free-for-all contest. This means it will not preclude former chairmen or people who have previously held the position. But when the time comes, part of what will be assessed should be how successful they were when they were in office. This will be considered at the final stage when all aspirants have come out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“The party Constitution allows for consensus. I would prefer the consensus opinion of the leadership, especially on zoning and on the personalities they want to occupy the position. This should be based on qualification, determination, previous achievements, commitment to the party, and other necessary qualities.If they are able to achieve that, we can then beat our chest and say, yes, our party is back.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Also, Olafeso stated that qualified party members were free to contest any position, noting that their competence would be scrutinised by party leaders and delegates.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>The former PDP Vice Chairman stated, “The beauty of democracy is that you’re given the chance to compete. But in that competition, people will take into consideration your performance in the past. Your pedigree and your competence will all be in consideration. So nobody should be excused or excluded from participating. Like we said, we want to actually strengthen our internal democracy and ensure that it’s an all-inclusive party activity. They are all welcome.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“But I can tell you that we’re doing everything possible to learn from the past and our mistakes and make the future a lot better for us, so that we can prepare the party, stabilize it for a future competition against the APC and the ruling party that have turned Nigeria into a graveyard of misery and pain for the Nigerian people.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Olafeso added that adopting a consensus approach would promote stability within the party, adding that they have learned from their previous mistakes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>He stated, “Knowing that we are in the opposition, knowing fully well that we are in the orthodox, it is very critical that we have internal communication amongst ourselves, arriving and ensuring that issues are resolved long before the convention. So, consensus is the way to go.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“And in the event that we are unable to reach that, that is when we throw everything out there to say, ‘okay, let the people decide.’ But I know that we must give consensus a try. It will save cost. It will save all the anxiety and the conflict in the party, and it will make us understand each other better, because consensus is give and take.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“The errors of the past are still haunting us. So, our commitment is to do the right thing in accordance with the constitution of the party and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“You can be rest assured that we are learning from our mistakes, and we’re doing everything possible to ensure that we come out of this very clean that all those who left can now return. Fairness and equity will be the watchwords today in this circumstance, and we’ll strive to keep doing that.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>In a related development, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, has warned that a fresh crisis capable of disrupting the convention could emerge if the NWC continues to reject the newly elected executives from the South-South congress held in Calabar, Cross River State.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Speaking during a media chat on Monday in Abuja, the minister stated that the party acted appropriately by reaffirming Senator Samuel Anyanwu as the substantive National Secretary.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>He noted that he had consistently maintained that the party must do the right thing by reinstating a secretary who was duly elected through a convention.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“I never insisted that Senator Anyanwu would be National Secretary. I insisted that the right thing must be done. If the right thing to be done is that Senator Anyanwu should be reaffirmed as National Secretary, so be it, that is what I insisted.  If the law takes place, so be it. And the law has taken place,” Wike said.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>The leadership crisis in the South-South and South-East zones of the party has persisted for some time and the former Governor of Rivers State cautioned that although the party’s crisis appears to be resolved for now, a new wave of conflict could arise if the party refused to acknowledge the zonal congress that elected Chief Dan Orbih as the National Vice Chairman for the South-South.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>He said, “Well, it is over for now. There are few things still remaining and I have told them that they must do it. Our congress was held in Calabar, and there’s nothing anybody can tell us. If they want to have another round of crisis, so be it. In that congress, Chief Dan Orbih emerged as National Vice Chairman from the congress. They never wanted the congress to hold. Congress was held.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“The so-called acting National Chairman of the party wrote a letter to INEC after congress was held on Saturday, that the congress has been postponed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>“There is no two ways about it. The National Vice Chairman of PDP South-South, is Chief Dan Orbih. If they don’t agree, that’s another round of crisis.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Wike also maintained that the party must address the issue of the South-East Zonal Chairman, Ali Odefa, who was expelled from the party following a court order from a competent jurisdiction.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>He added, “The South-East vice chairman, Ali Odefa is no longer a member of the party. These are the things I tell people, what I don’t like is impunity. And for someone like me, we will not condone it. I will not allow it. We will fight it except they correct it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Wike further warned that the upcoming national convention could descend  into crisis if the existing irregularities within the PDP were not addressed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Wike stated, “They said that they are going for their convention in November. I am not part of it until they have corrected it. Let us wait; there is still time for them to resolve it. Before you talk about convention, resolve the matter. If the matter is not resolved, there will be crisis.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>When contacted, the PDP National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, confirmed that arrangements had been made for the convention to proceed as scheduled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>In the timetable he shared with our correspondent, the sale of Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for national offices is set to commence on Wednesday, September 3, at the Directorate of Finance, National Secretariat, FCT, Abuja.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>The timetable, signed by Bature, states that Monday, September 22 is the deadline for the submission of completed Nomination and Expression of Interest forms.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>On September 26, the Directorate of Organisation/Mobilisation will begin processing the forms and forwarding them to the Screening Committee, with the screening of all aspirants for national offices scheduled to take place on Tuesday, September 30 at the National Secretariat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Reacting, the APC Director of Publicity, Bala Ibrahim, stated that the PDP’s November convention would yield no meaningful outcome.</span></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span>Ibrahim, in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH, stated, “You see, I had forgotten about the name PDP until you reminded me now.
